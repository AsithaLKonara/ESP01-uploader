# üîß ESP-01 Firmware Fix - Flashing Guide

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

The previous firmware had a **file storage bug** that caused uploaded files to show 0 bytes. This has been fixed in the new version.

## üìã **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Removed ArduinoJson dependency** - Was causing compilation errors
2. **Fixed file upload handler** - Files were being opened/closed for each chunk
3. **Improved error handling** - Better debugging and file system validation
4. **Added test endpoints** - To verify file system functionality

## üöÄ **Flashing Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Hardware Setup**
- Connect ESP-01 to USB-TTL converter:
  - ESP-01 VCC ‚Üí 3.3V
  - ESP-01 GND ‚Üí GND
  - ESP-01 TX ‚Üí USB-TTL RX
  - ESP-01 RX ‚Üí USB-TTL TX
  - ESP-01 GPIO0 ‚Üí GND (to enter flash mode)

### **Step 2: Arduino IDE Setup**
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to **File ‚Üí Preferences**
3. Add this URL to **Additional Board Manager URLs**:
   ```
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
4. Go to **Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Boards Manager**
5. Search for "ESP8266" and install "ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community"
6. Select board: **Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí ESP8266 Boards ‚Üí Generic ESP8266 Module**

### **Step 3: Install Required Libraries**
1. Go to **Tools ‚Üí Manage Libraries**
2. Install these libraries:
   - **ESP8266WiFi** (should be included with ESP8266 board package)
   - **ESP8266WebServer** (should be included with ESP8266 board package)
   - **LittleFS** (should be included with ESP8266 board package)
   - **Hash** (should be included with ESP8266 board package)

### **Step 4: Flash the Firmware**
1. Open `ESP01_Enhanced.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Set upload speed to **115200** (Tools ‚Üí Upload Speed)
3. Click **Upload** button
4. Wait for upload to complete

### **Step 5: Test the Fix**
1. Power on ESP-01 (remove GPIO0 connection)
2. Connect to WiFi network "MatrixUploader" (password: 12345678)
3. Open browser and go to `http://192.168.4.1`
4. Test file writing: `http://192.168.4.1/test-write`
5. Try uploading a file through LED Matrix Studio

## üîç **Verification Steps:**

### **Check Serial Monitor:**
```

LittleFS initialized successfully
Total space: 1048576 bytes
Used space: 0 bytes

===========================================
```

### **Test File Writing:**
- Visit `http://192.168.4.1/test-write`
- Should return: `{"success":true,"bytes_written":32,"test_file_size":32}`

### **Check File System Info:**
- Visit `http://192.168.4.1/fs-info`
- Should show available space and file count

## üéØ **Expected Results After Fix:**

1. **Files upload successfully** with correct size
2. **Hash verification passes** (local hash matches ESP-01 hash)
3. **File storage works** in LittleFS
4. **No more 0-byte files**

## üö® **If Issues Persist:**

1. **Check serial monitor** for error messages
2. **Verify LittleFS initialization** in setup
3. **Test file writing** with `/test-write` endpoint
4. **Check available flash space** (should be ~1MB)
5. **Verify WiFi connection** and IP address

## üì± **LED Matrix Studio Integration:**

After flashing, the ESP-01 upload button should work correctly:
- Files will be stored properly
- Hash verification will pass
- File sizes will be accurate
- ESP-01 optimization features will work

**The fix addresses the core issue where files were being corrupted during upload due to improper file handling in the upload process.**
